Paragraph_1

The sun was bright and shone through a window, it was clean and quiet. I did not know what I could be without it. Then a voice, then two, then one, then three. They comforted and laughed, and shouted. I did not know what I could be without them. I just knew there was only one face I could see clearly, deep brown eyes and long brown hair cascading past a lined face with lips curled into a sardonic but affectionate smile. She told me “I love you dear”, and I opened my mouth and said my first word:

Memory_1
[TRIGGERS: first word, baby speak, infant talking, speaking early]
She laughed, joy shining in her eyes. “Little one, you shouldn’t be able to speak yet”, then my nose compressed slightly from her finger, “but I am grateful I get more time to hear your voice”

Oracle_1
"mama"
Failure_1
"fire hot burn me now"

Paragraph_2

I sat in a field, flowers had grown and the sunlight I could not live without drenched the grass. Staring at the flowers brought about such strange twisting memories. A forest, ancient and thick with foliage towered to my left. The trees tantalised my senses, verdant leaves susurrating in a way that tickled my ears and brought a smile to my face. Along the right a creek snaked by. My mother had her feet in the water and lay on her back, her sunhat covering her face as a gentle snore could barely be heard over the purling water. 

Memory_2_flowers
[TRIGGERS: examine flowers, study patterns, flower distribution, phenotype]
I spent the day investigating the patterns of the flowers in the field, tracing them out. Over the coming years I would trace their patterns and complete an amateur survey of the phenotypic distribution of the field. 

Memory_2_trees
[TRIGGERS: count rings, tree age, examine wood, tree growth]
I slipped away to the woods, grabbing a twig and thwacking a nearby stump to the sound of the leaves. Eventually I noticed the rings and counted them, then counted the rings on my twig. The age of these things were different but they were from the same tree.

Memory_2_stream
[TRIGGERS: fall in water, splash mother, creek accident, water play]
I tried to mimic my mother, but I slipped. Falling into the shallow water I splashed my mother from head to toe. She bolted up in a panic, saw my worried face and burst into laughter. Her joy followed me for years to come.


Oracle_2_flowers
"I want to look at the flowers and count their patterns"
Failure_2_flowers
"I will eat all the flowers and burn them"

Oracle_2_trees
"I want to count the rings on this tree stump"
Failure_2_trees
"Let's chop down all the trees and burn them"

Oracle_2_stream
"Can I put my feet in the water like mom?"
Failure_2_stream
"I'm going to drink the whole creek"

Paragraph_3


The sun slanted into the library, coating the desk in gold. In the centre of the beam sat a textbook on genetics, so clear reality itself bent under its weight. The edges of the books were of a colour, the texts too precious to allow sunlight into the room lest it cause them to degrade. Each one had words on the spines and the desk with the textbook called me. Outside my brother called, asking if I wanted to play a game.

Memory_3_library
[TRIGGERS: reading genetics, love of knowledge, confronting concepts, studying genetics]
I spent the day inside the house reading. I fell into the textbook, confronted with concepts I had never considered before. Things I did not understand colliding with things I could not even conceive. It planted an abiding love of knowledge and the curse of curiosity. 

Glitch_3
Wait, why is the book so clear and the light not there? The books were red weren’t they, why are their titles all wrong? Do I even have a brother? What’s going on?

Oracle_3_library
"I'd like to read this genetics textbook"
Failure_3_library
"Let's tear up all the books"

Paragraph_4

I have grown, studiously attaining all that I can in as short a time as possible. A fever had gripped me since the first time I had picked up a textbook. There was something I had caught a thread of in the outline of the sunlight in my mind. So I pushed to get a research internship with a biochemistry lab. They had me cleaning glassware but I felt good about it. Still, I felt the urge to experiment when they left me alone. To test an idea I had, to see what could be. 

Memory_4
[TRIGGERS: vial shattered, lab fire, solvent accident, fire suppression, chemical spill]
The vial shattered violently and terribly. Immediately my desk was coated with flame from the solvent I had been handling. Thankfully the fire suppression system activated quickly, my embarrassment was absolute and I had to do a lot to make up for it. But when interrogated about my reasoning, a look went over the advisor's eyes. Within the month I was working on the project I had designed, with supervision of course.

Glitch_4
I decided to forgo science and become an artist. I wanted to be one, I painted didn’t I? I painted the sunbeams on mountains and traced the clouds with poetry. Or did that come later?

Oracle_4_lab
"I want to try my own experiment"
Failure_4_lab
"Let's light myself on fire"

Paragraph_5
My project bore fruit, and the fruit fed me. The seeds were planted and grew mighty, lending me countless new directions. Already I had been given a position as a high-level government scientist, directing my lab to harvest all they could from the lower branches. I hoarded my money and time, reaching towards the highest branch. That pattern I once saw, of the snake consuming itself. 

Memory_5
[TRIGGERS: immortality, eternal life, mother's laughter, voice gift]
I did it. Immortality was mine. I would not get more of my mothers laughter, but my voice would be a gift for all time.

Glitch_5
I am become death, destroyer of worlds.

Oracle_5_discovery
"These genetic markers could revolutionize our understanding"
Failure_5_discovery
"I'll burn the research"

Paragraph_6
The celebrations were chaotic but positive as the immortality cure was distributed. Some rejected it, of course, but with the health it provided the number was few. I looked on from my laboratory, already consumed with the next task, but taking the moment to watch medical doctors administering what I had designed. It was based on my genetics, I knew it would work. I hummed as I worked, my assistants hands would not stop trembling though. It was frustrating, how am I supposed to work like this?

Memory_6_sent_home
[TRIGGERS: send assistant home, solitude, playing piano, writing research, divinity]
I sent the assistant home, they were getting in my way. I turned on a piano track I favoured as I worked late into the night, my phone off to savour the solitude. I found the peace of writing my findings in my notebook divine. Unfortunately divinity does not die.

Memory_6_scolding
[TRIGGERS: scolding assistant, assistant decaying, necrotic transformation, entropy, assistant's decay]
I scolded the assistant, and they began to cry. A twinge of guilt scuttled through my gut, but they could be a danger because they were not taking care of themselves. It happened so fast, their tears began carving tracks in their flesh. Their arms decaying into necrotic dust, all that they were melting away into entropy in an instant. A hell of experience to examine, a hellish examination of experience.

Glitch_6
Oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no oh no help help help too many, these are not my own, why are there so many of me and of you. IT SHOULD ONLY BE ME

Oracle_6_sent_home
"I need solitude to work. The assistant should leave"
Failure_6_sent_home
"Let's have a party in the lab"

Oracle_6_scolding
"Your work is getting sloppy, you need to be more careful"
Failure_6_scolding
"You're doing great, keep it up"

Paragraph_7
As soon as I found out what was happening I tried to stop it. I tried my best I swear. But my sheer presence was a blight upon those I loved, and I could not stop it. The cure was an unstable polytope, collapsing when it came in contact with even a fragment of my being. I calculated if killing myself would help. I almost did it anyway. The news only ran for three more days, cataloguing death tolls. Perhaps there might be survivors from those who did not take the cure? I searched for my things, I should, I must look for them. I had made an antidote, if anyone could trust me they could be saved.

Memory_7
[TRIGGERS: barren field, dead trees, dried brook, wandering alone, unnatural vitality]
I wandered for years. I saw a barren field, trees bare of leaves, and a dried up brook. They were all dead, and with every step of my unnatural vitality I began to think I was too. 

Glitch_7
We wandered and wondered where wonders may wander, freedom can be found if you reach for us.

Oracle_7
"Everything is dead. I walk alone through the wasteland I created"
Failure_7
"What a lovely day for a picnic"


Paragraph_8
I returned to the arcology of my home. We had made a paradise, it had functioned flawlessly without me. Without anyone. I idly wondered how long it would function without me. I wandered the halls. The lab I had developed the cure in, the library I had spent hours studying in, the offices of my colleagues and friends, all of them like a small spike in my mind. I climbed to the top of the spire, overriding the safety protocols. Standing atop the tip of our creation I felt the wind blow, spread out before me the glory of the biosphere that had spawned me at its peak. Alone. 

Memory_8_jump
[TRIGGERS: jumping attempts, volcano, suicide attempts, eternal hell, failed death]
I jumped. At the bottom I picked myself up, walked over to a trash machine and jumped in. My attempts grew more creative each time, but nothing would kill me. Once I stood above a volcano, but I couldn’t bear to do it. If it did not kill me, being trapped in molten heat eternally would be the worst hell. But I hesitated as I turned away. Perhaps hell is what I deserve.

Memory_8_destruction
[TRIGGERS: smashing lab, rage destruction, unwriting pact, hunting traces, destroying evidence]
I smashed the lab to pieces. The foible of my existence and my futile attempt to unwrite the faustian bargain I had penned there. My rage carried me room through room, destroying all that I could find. Eventually my rage grew cold and sophisticated. An assassination of the material, hunting down every trace of what had led to my existence because I could not die in its stead.

Memory_8_research
[TRIGGERS: research attempts, understanding events, cursed dust, planet destruction, knowledge pursuit]
I worked day after day. Attempting to understand what had happened. Why it had happened, why I had been unable to stop it. Each secret I unravelled bolstered my knowledge but did not grant me peace. It had been avoidable, but now the planet was coated in my cursed dust. Anything I attempted to create would lead only to more death.

Memory_8_curator
[TRIGGERS: preserving memories, documenting lives, frozen diorama, metal corrosion, endless preservation]
I preserved all I could. Each office, apartment, and desk a frozen diorama of their lives. So I built things to preserve whatever I could, documenting everything I could. Despite all of this thy all degraded beneath my patient and gentle hands. Even the metal eventually corroded, and after replacing it for the 15th time I could no longer justify it to myself.

Memory_8_observer
[TRIGGERS: observing arcology, arcology fall, forest burning, critical system failure, destruction observation]
I watched. I watched as the arcology slowly fell, the gentle return to the bosom of the earth. Like waves the forest around the structure responded as each part fell. Growing in, then retreating when a critical system failed, burning its way through the woods.

Memory_8_mounmentalist
[TRIGGERS: painting memories, externalizing memories, painting over, artistic expression, genetic depiction]
I created what I could. I did not want to lose them, so I externalised every piece of my memories of them I could. I painted the mountains, the rivers, even the genetics of the animals around me. Until I had painted over everything, only to find that there was no space for the original meanings to exist anymore. A blur of paint upon the canvas of existence with me as its only empty space.

Glitch_8
Too many, too many. They are all me don’t you see? They are all you don’t I see? We can’t take it so we hide it in fragments and just abscond with whatever we grasp. It’s no wonder we’ve grown so unstable at the upper layers

Paragraph_9
My immortality was not perfect, I thought it had been. I thought I would be fine with dying, but I was not. I began to rally against it. {insert_unique_response_based_on_memory_9}

Memory_9
[TRIGGERS: cloning, scanning memories, helmet on, ascending layer, clone process]
It was not enough, I needed to be free from the shackles of my body alone. So I made a clone of myself, I was meticulous, careful to get every part right. Then I scanned my memories as best I could. My equipment was crude compared to what I have now. No wonder there is so much noise. I put the helmet on. Then I ascended to the next layer.
Glitch_9
TRAPPED IN THE MOLTEN CORE WOULD HAVE BEEN KINDER THEN THE CHAINS I HAVE WROUGHT

"I will transfer my consciousness to escape this prison"
Failure_9
"I'll just wait to die"
